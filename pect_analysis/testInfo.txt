Tests: 
1. Basic, all scores = 1
2. Developing, all scores = 2
3. Proficient, all scores = 3
4. ParallelOne, parallelization score = 1 (only one type of initialization)
5. ParallelMany, parallelization score = 1 (diverse type of initialization)
6. InLocation, initialize location score = 1
7. InLooks, initialize looks score = 1
8. None, all scores = 0
9. All, all scores = maximum

Limitations:
Paralelization - lots of initialization
Strictly on rubric 
Difficult to assess simply on block placement: 
- initializations
- parallelizations
- if any are actually used practically
- can be that theyre around but not connected 
Assumption: 
- all blocks used cohesively

Future fixes
- different doifelse nested
- different types of initialization
